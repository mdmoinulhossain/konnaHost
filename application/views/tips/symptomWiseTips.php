                    <li>This is one of the frequent illnesses among teenagers. It's incredibly infectious, particularly if the infected person doesn't wash their hands properly. </li>
                    <li>The virus can live in surfaces and unknowingly another person can get affected when they touch their nose, eye or mouth. Symptoms include nausea, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and, on rare occasions, fever. It can last from a few hours to several days.
